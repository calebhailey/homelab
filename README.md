## Roadmap

This is the general direction I'm headed. It's aspirational at best, and 100%
guaranteed to change (or your money back).

- [ ] Provision a handcrafted/bespoke home lab server (SmartOS on Intel NUC)
- [ ] Provision a handcrafted/bespoke K8s cluster (K3s?)
- [ ] Monitor the home lab w/ Sensu Go :boom:
- [ ] Automate DDNS
- [ ] Run some software!!!
- [ ] Automate K8s cluster provisioning
- [ ] Automate home lab server provisioning
- [ ] High availability (home lab cluster)
